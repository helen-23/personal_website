            <!-- Intro -->
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>BubbleMania is a clone of the Puzzle Bobble video game from 1994. I wrote this game in Grade 11 using self-taught ActionScript3, and since this is a personal project, I have uploaded all source code on GitHub. Portal to the code is <a href="https://github.com/helen-23/Bubble-Mania/">here</a>. Below is also a short demo of the game I recorded:</p>

            <!-- Gameplay -->
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>At the start of each round, the top five rows of the playing arena is occupied by a prearranged pattern of colored bubbles. Down the center of the screen, there is a standalone bubble waiting to be launched. A player can click in a direction and the bubble will be shot upwards in a straight line following that direction. The task of the game is to clear the arena by forming groups of three or more like-colored bubbles, and to do that, the player must aim a new bubble towards a cluster of bubbles in the arena. The player has 2 minutes to clear all the bubbles without any bubbles crossing the bottom line. </p>

            <!-- Algorithm -->
            <h2>Algorithm</h2>
            <p>Breadth First Search is used for detecting whether the new bubble is directly adjacent to any like-colored bubbles in the arena. There are five types of colored bubbles in BubbleMania: white, yellow, cyan, blue, and red. The entire playing arena is represented by a 2D array and the first five rows are initialized with a set of bubbles in randomly generated colors. All new bubbles that show up at the bottom of the screen are also randomly generated once a previous one is fired. When a new bubble is launched, keep track of its position (x and y coordinates) and map it to the corresponding entry in the 2D array. When it reaches an entry that is adjacent to one or more entries that are already occupied by a bubble, then this new bubble is snapped to the position of the nearest array entry using Euclidean distance. Finally, BFS is used to search all adjacent bubbles for matching colors. If a cluster of like-colored bubbles are identified, the entire cluster is “popped” and cleared from the screen.</p>
